Three Generations Seeking Romance: A Data Science Approach to Profiling Online Daters According to Age and Generation

Hi! This is my capstone project for my course in Machine Learning Fundamentals for Codecademy.

Requirements
============
The OKCupid dataset "profiles.csv" must be present in the same path as the .py file.

Problem Statements
==================
1. Can your dating profile predict your age?
2. Can your dating profile predict the generation you belong to?

Description
============
Using a dataset of almost 60,000 anonymized entries from the dating platform OKCupid, we’ll explore the above questions using supervised machine learning techniques. We’ll examine different aspects or features of user profiles and see which ones we’ll integrate into our models to achieve the most satisfactory scores.

We’ll use regression techniques to tackle the first question and classification models to address the second.

Concepts Employed
=================
Scikit-Learn:
- Multiple Linear Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors Weighted Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier
- Support Vectors Machine Classifier
Data Visualization:
- Matplotlib (line charts, histogram, bar charts)
- Seaborn (heat maps)
